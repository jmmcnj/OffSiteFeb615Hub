Solution for OffSite Day Feb 6 2015

Solution consists of 3 projects

1. ImpreziJS - This is a copy of the http://bartaz.github.io/impress.js/#/bored source and customization.  There is a public tool out there
that also provides a "canvas" like feel called http://www.prezi.com, havent used it but looks like it gives you an admin interface 
which impressjs does not have but impress covers 3D effect which prezi doesnt but not sure how much that really is needed in most
presentation scenarios.

2. NodeExpressApp1 - Example of the visual studio plug in that spins you up a Node/Express, Jade (Node based Templating Engine for HTML
Templates) and Source-maps (mapper between minified and original js files).  Take a look and should be able to spin up with F5 and 
see the OOTB MVC template home page you may be used to seeing in the ASP.NET MVC project.

3. ReactJS - Nuget Package I installed and spun up, that utilizes the js view engine that Facebook and Instagram uses and supports.
Check it out - very powerful and easy to use - http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/why-react.html
